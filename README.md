NASA APOD webpage

APOD or astronomical picture of the day is a picture released by NASA for every day from one of their telescopes out there. NASA 
provides an Web API Service (Link: https://api.nasa.gov/). Which is totally free, and has well documented APIs. So I made use of the APOD API for my JS project, which will show a new APOD release from NASA every 24 hours (day).


Thank you!
